Zion Library System is a complete application that you may learn from,use
or distribute. you can do anything that you want with the submission.

its an excellent graphical user interface library managment system to 
track books in the library,library Members and library borrowings.
 
I designed three user access levels to provide retrictions and limitations to other users
other than the administrator.


you will notice as you use it that the sofware is almost a commercial
software which has so many features that you can use or try to learn from 
as you explore its code.

you may replace the graphics flash files according to your liking.
some of the original flash,wav,bitmaps were replaced to trim down its 
file size.

do not forget to place the usermanual(pdf) in windows directory.

some of the modules were borrowed from some programmers in planet source
code.

thanks a lot to fellow programmers I learned a lot from them 
 specially to the developer of hme library where i patterned my system design after.

the system is not free of bugs as it it still in its development process
and not yet finished...
